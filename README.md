___a Study on the Architecture Method Applying `Datascape`___ </div>
#  
#### ___Research Purpose___<br>

> ___📖 Research for Computational Design and Geometric Algorithm___
>
> ___Abstract ▽___
> _This study is meaningful in providing a new perspective on architecture through analysis and understanding of `datascape`, by customizing different views of architectural space and programs._
> 
> _The `physical environment` and social constraints that make up the city today (in the fields of politics, economy, society, environment, etc.) are affecting all industries, including architecture. These factors act as an unthinkable series of `external conditions` separate from architecture and greatly influence the determination of the condition of a city and a building._

>  _Datascape is a `data-driven architectural design` technique that uses the basis of design as data. Therefore, it is easy to collect and process data, has a well-established machine learning environment, and uses language that provides a `Rhino` & `Revit` scripting environment._<br>
