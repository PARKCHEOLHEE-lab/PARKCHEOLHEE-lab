> ___Abstract â–½___<br>
> _This study is significant in providing a `new insight` on architecture by different views of architectural space and programs through analysis and understanding of data-scapes._
> 
> _The `physical environment` and social constraints that make up the city today (in the fields of politics, economy, society, environment, etc.) are affecting all industries, including architecture. These factors act as an unthinkable series of `external conditions` separate from architecture and greatly influence the determination of the condition of a city and a building._
