#### ___Research Purpose___<br>

> ___📖 Research for Computational Design and Geometric Algorithm___
>
> ___Abstract ▽___<br>
> _This study is significant in providing a `new insight` on architecture by different views of architectural space and programs through analysis and understanding of data-scapes._
> 
> _The `physical environment` and social constraints that make up the city today (in the fields of politics, economy, society, environment, etc.) are affecting all industries, including architecture. These factors act as an unthinkable series of `external conditions` separate from architecture and greatly influence the determination of the condition of a city and a building._

>  _Datascape is a `data-driven architectural design` technique that uses the basis of design as data. Therefore, it is easy to collect and process data, has a well-established machine learning environment, and uses language that provides a `Rhino` & `Revit` scripting environment._<br>
